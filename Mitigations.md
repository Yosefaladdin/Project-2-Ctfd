Mitigation Strategies

Content Security Policy (CSP): Implementing CSP can help prevent XSS attacks by specifying which dynamic resources are allowed to load.

Input Sanitization: User inputs should always be sanitized and validated to prevent injection attacks.

Use of Prepared Statements: Prepared statements with parameterized queries should be used to prevent SQL injection.

Proper File Handling: File uploads should be handled securely by checking file types, content, and not executing server-side scripts from uploads.

Strong Password Policies and Account Lockout Mechanisms: To defend against brute force attacks, implement account lockout mechanisms after several failed attempts and enforce strong password policies.

Regular Code Audits: Regular code reviews and audits can detect vulnerabilities before they are exploited.

Training and Awareness: Conduct regular training sessions for developers and staff to recognize and prevent security threats.
